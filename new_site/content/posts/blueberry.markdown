Blueberry season comes and goes too quickly. I love blueberries. This year I was given a membership to a CSA / community supported farming group as a birthday present, which resulted in over 20lbs / 10kg of blueberries. That’s a lot of blueberries – but I am still loving them, even as I get to the last few pounds.

Last year  I talked about how great it would be to make blueberry jam. This year I had the opportunity. There’s nothing better than rich jam on buttered toast.

This is the recipe I used:


> 5 cups fresh blueberries
> 2.5 cups sugar (wow!)
> 2 tbsp fresh squeezed lime
> a half teaspoon of lime zest

My verdict? It’s great, but I need some tasters for real feedback. Next time I’ll use less sugar – perhaps 2 cups – and less lime.
