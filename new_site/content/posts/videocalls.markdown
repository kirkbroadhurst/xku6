I’m an immigrant, and it’s exhausting. I try to call my parents once a week. I try to call my brother every couple weeks. I try to call someone else when I can – friends, family.

But at the same time I’m trying to be present in the here and now, and I’m busy doing things in the real world. Plus of course I’m working.  And it’s summer so it’s a chance to do something outside which I don’t want to miss.

So I video call my parents once a week. It’s harder to talk than it would be on a regular call, but it’s fun to see them. Imagine that – video calls are free, but phone calls are going to cost me at least a few cents.
